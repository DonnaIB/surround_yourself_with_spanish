[Surround Yourself with Spanish - Live site](https:xxxxx)


*Note: This is an extension to the fictional organisation (Dublin Intercambio) created for my earlier Code Institute milestone projects.*

## Introduction
The organisers of Dublin Intercambio want to create a site that allows members to make recomendatiion, and view recommendations from other members for movies, series, books, songs and podcasts
to aid members learn Spanish.

Once language learners get to an intermediatory level they start looking for ways to immerse themselves in the language, to get more input, to listen to native speakers talking naturally with 
different accents, colloquial sayings, slang, etc. Learners are often encouraged to watch movies, read books, listen to songs etc. and this is often discussed at the language exchange events. This is why the organisers of Dublin Intercambio want to create a space online to bring all these recommendations together and that can be shared with their members.

## Scope 
Create a simple, intuitive, and responsive website that acts as a respository of recommendations that users can browse and contribute to. 

The structure should adhere to convention and be simple and intuitive, ensuring the user always knows where they are, how they got there and how to get back to 
where they started.

The design should be simple, utilising the same colour palette, 

Any addition features or functionally are out of scope at this stage.

User goals:
* To find recommendations of Spanish movies, books, series, podcasts and songs from fellow language learners.
* To share recommendations with fellow language learners.
* To improve their Spanish language fluency.
* To be part of a Spanish language learning online community.

Website owners goals:
* To build on and expand the commuity of language learnings that are part of Dublin Intercambio.
* To create a safe and welcoming platform for users to share recommendations of movies, books, etc. to enhance their learning outside of a classroom environment.
* To encourage users to create their own recommendations for other learners based on their language learning journey.
* To build in the ability for admins to edit and delete any uphelpful comments that may be added to ensure the stays safe and welcoming for the language learning community.
