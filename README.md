[Surround Yourself with Spanish - Live site](https:xxxxx)


*Note: This is an extension to the fictional organisation (Dublin Intercambio) created for my earlier Code Institute milestone projects.*

## Introduction
The organisers of Dublin Intercambio want to create a site that allows members to make recomendatiion, and view recommendations from other members for movies, series, books, songs and podcasts
to aid members learn Spanish.

Once language learners get to an intermediatory level they start looking for ways to immerse themselves in the language, to get more input, to listen to native speakers talking naturally with 
different accents, colloquial sayings, slang, etc. Learners are often encouraged to watch movies, read books, listen to songs etc. and this is often discussed at the language exchange events. This is why the organisers of Dublin Intercambio want to create a space online to bring all these recommendations together and that can be shared with their members.

## Scope 
Create a simple, intuitive, and responsive website that acts as a respository of recommendations that users can browse and contribute to. 

The structure should adhere to convention and be simple and intuitive, ensuring the user always knows where they are, how they got there and how to get back to 
where they started.

The design should be simple, utilising the same colour palette, 

Any addition features or functionally are out of scope at this stage.

User goals:
* To find recommendations of Spanish movies, books, series, podcasts and songs from fellow language learners.
* To share recommendations with fellow language learners.
* To improve their Spanish language fluency.
* To be part of a Spanish language learning online community.

Website owners goals:
* To build on and expand the commuity of language learnings that are part of Dublin Intercambio.
* To create a safe and welcoming platform for users to share recommendations of movies, books, etc. to enhance their learning outside of a classroom environment.
* To encourage users to create their own recommendations for other learners based on their language learning journey.
* To build in the ability for admins to edit and delete any uphelpful comments that may be added to ensure the stays safe and welcoming for the language learning community.

## UX

#### User stories

##### A typical user of this site would:
* Have an interest in improving their Spanish language skills.

2. As a new visitor to the website, I want to find recommendations easily from fellow language learners without the need to register.
3. As a new visitor to the website, I want to be able to register easily and add recommendations.
4. As a new visitor to the website, I want to be able to filter recommendations by category and/or level.

2. As a logged in visitor to the website, I want to be able to easily view my recommendations.
3. As a logged in visitor to the website, I want to be able to easily edit my recommendations.
4. As a logged in visitor to the website, I want to be able to easily delete my recommendations.
5. As a logged in visitor to the website, I want to be given visual confirmation when I edit or delete my recommendataions that the update has been successful.


### Design: 
With this site, I wanted to ensure the design is simple, modern, fully responsive and has a connection to the [Dublin Intercambio](https://donnaib.github.io/dublin_intercambio/) site from my Ms1 project, this connection will be achieved by utilising the same color palette and logo throughout. As before the inspiration for this colour palette was to harness the Spanish connection and influence of the project.

As I have stated before I am aware that yellow can sometimes be a problematic colour, however it remains an important element of the design due the fact that it is a key colour of the Spansih flag. With this in mind special attention as always was given to testing the contract of the white text against the yellow backgrounds to ensure readability.

Here is the colour palette for this site.

!['Colour Palette'](static/readme_images/color_palette.png)

Boostrap and Material Design icons are used throughout to realise the simple, modern and fully responsive design.

I used Balsamiq to create detailed Wireframes for mobile and desktop site, for tablet devices the layout will follow either the mobile or desktop views depending on the size of the screen.

### Wireframes

#### Mobile View

#### Larger Screen View

As with my previous project I was very aware that working with yellow in the colour pallete can be problematic. However, as always I was careful to utilize the color in a way that added to the design of the site, but didn't not compromise the accessibility of the site.

## Features

### Pages 

##### Home


### Site Features 
Every page on this site also incorporates the following features:
* A logo in the top left hand corner, that not only forms part of the branding and design of the site but also as is consistent with a user's expectations, clicking the logo will return the user to the 
home page of the site.
* A responsive, collapsible navigation bar, allowing users to easily navigate the site on any device.

### Possible Features to Implement in Future


## Technologies Used for building this site
- This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages.
- Gitpod was used an the IDE for building the site.
- **Bootstrap4** was used to assist with the structure, responsiveness and browser compatibility of the site. 
- **Material Design** was used for the icons in the site.
- **Google fonts** was used to style the website fonts.
- **jQuery** to reference Javascript needed for the responsive navbar.
- **Popper.js** reference Javascript needed for the responsive navbar.
- **Google Maps** to create map and markers on contact page.
- **EmailJS** to connect the contact form to website owners Gmail account.

## Testing

I tested the site in the following ways:

1. Initially I used the inspector tool to test the site in all the screen sizes and devices available in the Chrome developer tool.  In addition to this I also tested it on live devices, including but not limited to iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, MotoG7. 

2. I also tested my code using the validator tools for both my HTML [W3C HTML Validator Tool](https://validator.w3.org/), CSS [W3C CSS Validator Tool](https://validator.w3.org/).

Screen shots of the HTML & CSS validator results can be viewed below, as you can see there were no errors detected.

![HTML Validation Report - ](xx)
![CSS Validation Report](xx)

3. All links were tested to ensure there were no broken links and that all links to external sites open in a new tab.

4. In addition to testing with the inspector tool, real devices and validation tools, I also work through a series of test cases, to ensure that the site met the users stories and that any functionality that was added worked as intended.

### User Story Test Cases
1. As a new visitor to the website, I want to understand the purpose of the site and how to interact with it.


2. As a new visitor to the website, I want to find recommendations easily from fellow language learners without the need to register.


3. As a new visitor to the website, I want to be able to register easily and add recommendations.

4. As a new visitor to the website, I want to be able to filter recommendations by category and/or level.


5.  As a returning visitor to the website, I want to be able view recently added recommendations.


6. As a returning visitor to the website, I want to be able to log in easily and view my recommendations.


7. As a returning visitor to the website, I want to be able to log in easily and edit my recommendations.


8. As a returning visitor to the website, I want to be able to log in easily and delete my recommendations.


9. As a returning visitor to the website, I want to be given visual confirmation when I edit or delete my recommendataions that the update has been successful.
